                Hello! My name is Josef Neil S. Lechoncito, and I am a Computer Science college student at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, currently enrolled in Section A222.

                I would describe myself as an ambivert. I tend to be reserved in unfamiliar settings but can be quite outgoing and lively when I'm around my close friends. I enjoy meaningful conversations and thrive in environments where I feel comfortable.
                
                I was born on May 25, 2004, which makes me 20 years old. Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by technology and problem-solving, which naturally led me to pursue Computer Science.
                
                In my free time, I indulge in my favorite hobby: playing video games. Gaming is not just a form of entertainment for me, it serves as a way to challenge myself, improve my strategic thinking, and even unwind after a long day. Apart from that, I find solace in taking long walks at night, as it gives me time to reflect, relax, and appreciate the tranquility of my surroundings.
                
                As a student, I consider myself hardworking, diligent, and intellectually driven. I constantly strive for excellence, embracing challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it’s tackling complex coding problems or refining my skills in various aspects of Computer Science, I always put forth my best effort to achieve my goals and push my limits.
