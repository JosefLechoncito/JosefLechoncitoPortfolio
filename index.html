                Hello! My name is Josef Neil S. Lechoncito, and I am a Computer Science college student at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, currently enrolled in Section A222.

                I would describe myself as an ambivert. I tend to be reserved in unfamiliar settings but can be quite outgoing and lively when I'm around my close friends. I enjoy meaningful conversations and thrive in environments where I feel comfortable.
                
                I was born on May 25, 2004, which makes me 20 years old. Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by technology and problem-solving, which naturally led me to pursue Computer Science.
                
                In my free time, I indulge in my favorite hobby: playing video games. Gaming is not just a form of entertainment for me, it serves as a way to challenge myself, improve my strategic thinking, and even unwind after a long day. Apart from that, I find solace in taking long walks at night, as it gives me time to reflect, relax, and appreciate the tranquility of my surroundings.
                
                As a student, I consider myself hardworking, diligent, and intellectually driven. I constantly strive for excellence, embracing challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it’s tackling complex coding problems or refining my skills in various aspects of Computer Science, I always put forth my best effort to achieve my goals and push my limits.

            <h3 class = "heeders"><u>1st Year</u></h3>
            <p class = "paragraphs">During my first year in college, everything felt overwhelming at first. It was my first real exposure to learning how to code properly, and since my coding experience in high school was minimal, I often found myself struggling to keep up with the fast-paced lessons. There were moments of frustration and self-doubt, but there were also times of excitement and accomplishment whenever I successfully wrote a working program. Overall, my first-year experience was a rollercoaster of emotions—filled with challenges, learning curves, and small victories that kept me going.</p>
            <h3 class = "heeders"><u>2nd Year</u></h3>
            <p class = "paragraphs">Now that I am in my second year, I feel like I am finally getting the hang of college life. I have become more confident in my programming skills, I can now code more efficiently, make better decisions regarding variable selection, and choose the most suitable algorithms for a given problem. Compared to my first year, I can clearly see how much I have improved, both in terms of technical skills and time management. I volunteered to join a pitching competition in thailand which we landed on 4th place, that was my first ever competition globally and we ranked a quite high place which i was proud of since it reflected my hardwork and skills as a cs student. While there are still challenges ahead, I am more prepared and motivated to keep learning and growing as a Computer Science student especially in web programming since i am not the creative type of person when it comes to designing stuff, but i will do my very best to improve my craft in web development.</p>
